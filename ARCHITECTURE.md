# PORTFOLIO SITE — Architecture

Static HTML/CSS/JS on Vercel, **no build step** (one exception below). One
page (`index.html`), one stylesheet, one plain script — no modules, no
framework. The games live under `games/` with their own ARCHITECTURE.md
each; this file covers the site shell, the image pipeline, and the hooks.

## Modules

- `index.html` — single-page shell: sidebar, hero, featured work, games, AI
  Lab (5 tabs), Collab (shared builds — dormant, see below), about/toolkit/picks,
  Idea Vault (AES-GCM blob in `data-vault`), contact. Eight native `<dialog>`
  overlays (app embed, wallpaper lightbox, prompt reader, vault, shared
  game/app gallery, work mockup, resume, contact)
- `script.js` — plain script, feature blocks as IIFEs, executes top-to-bottom
  with `<script>` at the end of body. Major blocks: accent/theme system
  (7 accents; `applyAccent` sets `--accent`, rebuilds the SVG favicon,
  swaps mascots), `probeMascot()` (clones the real `<picture>` so the browser
  negotiates the one true file — **never hand-build derivative URLs**), Work
  overlay (**mockup** — see CLAUDE.md; `TEMPORARY MOCKUP DATA` block, filler
  SVGs; everything after it renders `{title, desc, src, w, h}` and is
  data-shape-agnostic; hero is a fixed 3:2 box on purpose), one `initTabs()`
  behind four tablists, wallpapers carousel/lightbox (self-builds from
  `.wp-item` figures), `initAppInfo()`/`initAppModal()` (the apps are ROWS
  stacked in the statement column under the AI LAB heading (`#aiApps`,
  hidden with the Apps panel the way `#wpThumbs` follows Wallpapers); each
  `.ai-card` row is a non-interactive container with three targets: name +
  mini line on the left are the out-link `<a>` (new tab; both lines
  underline on hover), the eyeball `<button>` — authored only on rows with
  `data-app-modal` — opens the app overlay, and a click anywhere else
  selects the row (`.is-current` holds the accent frame; seeded on the
  first row); the mark sits at the row's far right via flex `order`, so the
  generated `<picture>` never moves in the DOM, and wears no wrap border —
  the plates' corner radii differ per mark; the Apps panel across from the
  list shows the selection: the app's NAME large, then its first
  `.gal-item` shot (centred, up to 660px; cloned never borrowed; opens the
  shared viewer via `gallery:open`; no shots collapses it), then lead,
  description and tags — no marketplace button; the eyeball hides below
  768px where the overlay declines),
  `initCollabInfo()` (fills the Collab panel and builds
  each card's brain row + invite link from the card's own `data-people` /
  `data-invite`; adding a project is one card, no JS edit), vault, clips,
  prompts, song player, resume overlay, Web3Forms contact (public access key
  — by design)
- `styles.css` — banner-delimited sections; icon system is baked CSS mask
  data-URIs (`tools/bake_icons.py`); accents are one `--accent` variable,
  never filter chains
- Root wrapper folders `surveyor/ chomp/ arena1/ stickland/` — thin pages
  that iframe `/games/<name>/index.html`, focus the frame (so Escape/WASD
  reach the game), forward the query string, and leave the game on refresh
  (`refresh-home.js`, external file because CSP bans inline). All URLs
  root-absolute: Vercel serves both `/name` and `/name/`
- `splitmob/` — Vite build **output** served directly (source at
  `ai/apps/uvote/`; the one build-step exception). `ai/apps/` contract is in
  its README
- `tools/` — `bake_images.py` (sole writer of `assets/derived/`),
  `bake_markup.py` (owns every `<picture>` block), `image_slots.py` (LADDERS/
  SLOTS/SIBLINGS — the single source of truth), `check_scope.py` (commit-msg
  scope hook), `bake_favicon.py`, `bake_icons.py`, `check_accents.py` (the
  7-accent palette is duplicated in 5 places and must stay byte-identical),
  `seal_vault.mjs`, `build_docs_pdf.mjs`. Hooks are versioned in
  `tools/hooks/` and installed once via `bake_images.py --install-hooks`
- `vercel.json` — CSP in three scopes: root is strict (`script-src 'self'`,
  no inline, connect only to Web3Forms); `/games/*` adds `'unsafe-inline'
  blob:` + Photon websockets + `frame-ancestors 'self'`; `/splitmob/*`
  strict but frameable. `assets/derived/` is `immutable` for a year — hence
  the `?v=<8 hex of the master's bytes>` stamp on every generated URL

## Collab (shared builds)

One card per project in `#collab`, same contract as the AI Lab app cards:
everything lives on the card as `data-*` (`data-people` is the single source
for both the brain row and the panel's collaborator list; `data-invite`, when
present, renders a + linking to the repo's collaborators settings page). The
architecture is deliberately NOT in this repo: each collab project is its own
GitHub repo (adding a collaborator there IS the invite — no auth or roles on
the site) with its own Vercel project, rewritten to `/collab/<slug>/` in
`vercel.json` so the existing app overlay and CSP work unchanged. No rewrite
exists yet — the first project card is a stamped placeholder.

DORMANT right now: no nav link (commented out in the nav), no `sections`
entry in the scroll spy, and the panel + grid wear `hidden` behind a CSS-only
UNDER CONSTRUCTION plate (`.collab-soon`). The machinery is finished and
tested, not deleted — going live is dropping the two `hidden` attributes and
the plate, restoring the nav link and the `sections` entry, and putting real
data on the card.

## The image pipeline (full rules in CLAUDE.md — the short version)

Masters under `assets/`, derivatives generated into `assets/derived/`
mirroring the master's subfolder. Adding an image = drop the file + one
`<!-- img src=… slot=… alt=… --><!-- /img -->` directive; the pre-commit
hook bakes and fills in everything (`<picture>`, srcsets, `sizes`,
dimensions). Never edit inside the markers, never type width/height, never
build a derivative URL in JS. Ladders/`sizes` live per-SLOT in
`image_slots.py`. AVIF q58 / WebP q76. Budget: ≤150 KB per image on the
wire, hero LCP < 1.2 s on cold 4G. The two blocking checks:

    python tools/bake_images.py --check
    python tools/bake_markup.py --check

## Call flow at page load

Reload → scroll-to-top + hash strip (except `#resume`). Accent picker builds
and applies the stored accent before first paint matters; reveal/scroll-spy/
parallax bind; remaining IIFEs run inline. On `load`: re-measure, hand the
URL to the scroll spy, then idle-warm the other six mascots one accent at a
time via `probeMascot`.

## Commit hooks

`pre-commit` (only fires when rasters/markup/palette files are staged):
`check_accents.py` → bake images → bake markup → `bake_markup --check`.
Stages `index.html` **whole**. `commit-msg` → `check_scope.py`: a commit may
not span "projects" (each `games/<name>`, each other top-level dir, the repo
root as one unit) unless the message carries a `Spans:` line naming every
one. One exemption: `assets` + root-`index.html` only (the documented
add-an-image flow).

## Numbers

7 accents (lime default) · 11 ladders / 15 slots in `image_slots.py` ·
~50 generated markup blocks in index.html · fallback ladder
1600/1200/900/600/400/200 · cache stamp = 8 hex of sha256(master) ·
`styles.css?v=` / `script.js?v=` bumped by hand.

## Known-outstanding

The Work overlay is a mockup (no `work.json`, filler SVGs — do not build on
its taxonomy). Clips point at an unresolvable placeholder video host on
purpose. The Collab section is dormant — off the nav, content hidden behind
an UNDER CONSTRUCTION plate — until the first collab repo exists. See
`docs/STATUS.md` for the live list and open decisions.
